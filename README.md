Database Commander with oldschool ncurses-like UI. In memories of NC and clones :)

## A bit of history ...already

This work has started in Gophergala-2016 hackathon. 
I planned features and UI of this app several years ago but each time can't find motivations to start it. 
The hackathon give me such motivation. Well after starting I found what this project requires significantly more time 
than couple of days so I cancel my participation in the hackathon and continue development after it.

## Notes about development

Text UI based on excellent https://github.com/nsf/termbox-go library.
